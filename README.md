## Stroke Prediction - Binary Classification using a Convolutional Neuronal Network
The goal of this project is to predict an **impending** stroke by training a convolutional neural network for this binary classification task, utilizing various predictor variables. 

***Berlin, Ko Tao, Parque Nacional Corcovado, San Diego, and Tulum***.  

The project is divided into two main parts:  
Both *historical* and *current* weather data collection and analysis.
